-> In this workshop, I have learnt various concepts into the advanced C++ programming. First of all, I came to know about how to accept arguments from the command line at the time of execution. Moreover, I understood the difference between signed and unsigned variables as unsigned variables are used for only positive values whereas signed variables can be used for both positive and negative values. I used external linkage for the global system clock variable which was defined in the event module and it was used throughout the entire solution. Static variables are variables that retain their value after function call. Further, I used a static variable counter which counts the number of times of which the display function is called, instead of using a global variable for this purpose, a static variable is used. In the first part, I used the description member variable with a statically allocated size of 128 characters but afterwards I converted the member variable to use dynamic memory and allocate only the required amount of memory for the variable.
